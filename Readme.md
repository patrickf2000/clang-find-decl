## Clang Find Decl

This is a simple tool for iterating through a C/C++ file and collecting information about tag declarations. The tool outputs collected information about the input file to standard output. The tool is designed to be used in conjunction with the test script to assemble a CSV file.

To run the tool, build the C++ tool, and run "test.sh". Any test files go in the "test" folder. All data will be saved to "output.csv".
